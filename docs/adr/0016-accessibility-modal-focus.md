# Handling tab focus within modals

Date: 2023-08-22

## Status

2023-08-22: Proposed

## Context

Since the application need to comply with the accessibility rules we want to make it easier to deal with tab focus in modals.

## Decision

The package react-focues-trap (https://www.npmjs.com/package/focus-trap-react) is a simple wrapper that creates a focus trap out of the box.
