# Schemas

## Configuration

The application's configuration is provided by [`app.base.json`](../../app.base.json). That file contains default values that will allow you to run the application locally

Instance specific configuration is, at the time of writing, provided by [`signals-amsterdam`](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals-amsterdam) and [`signals-weesp`](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals-weesp). During Docker build, the correct configuration is [mounted into the container](../../Dockerfile#L72).<br />
See [the `Dockerfile` in the `signals-amsterdam` repository](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals-amsterdam/blob/develop/Dockerfile#L5).
